let list = ['a','b','c','d']
list.pop()
console.log(list)
/*Is there any way to have a line of code recall or go back to
a previous code line that executed before a permanent command did?
In other words as above shown, if you .pop an array without assiging
a variable to store the .pop, you lose the item that was popped.
Can you at some future point tell the code to go back to a line of
code before the .pop execution and basically "reset" the list? As 
of now, it seems easier to just make it into a variable, but I'm
thinking of a long code where the .pop is random and maybe in the
future the user or coder wants to recall what the list looked like
in the past. I am also thinking that if you contain all code within
a () after the original array then you could maybe resolve it that
way but idk how.
